# Server placement using memetic algorithm
## Memetic Algorithms 
Memetic algorithms combine genetic algorithms with local search. Memetic algorithms are inspired by memes (Dawkins, 1976), 
pieces of mental ideas, like stories, ideas, and gossip, which reproduce (propagate) themselves through a population of 
meme carriers. Corresponding to the selfish gene idea (Dawkins, 1976) in this mechanism each meme uses the 
host(the individual) to propagate itself further through the population, and in this way competes with different 
memes for the limited resources (there is always limited memory and time for knowing and telling all ideas and stories).

### First-visit Hill-Climbing
We use local hillclimbing on each newly created individual. This local hillclimber is a first-visit method; the first change which improves the individual is used. So in this problem.
We use arrays of nodes for the individuals in our experiments and use the simplest neighbourhood function as possible which contains only individuals generated by a mutation of a single bit. Of course, this is an important choice, but we did not want to optimize the neighbourhood function, since this would require a priori knowledge or a lot of testing from which only the memetic algorithms could profit and not the genetic algorithms to which they are compared. Furthermore, the best used neighbourhood size seems to be very dependent on the specific chosen test problems. The local hillclimber starts with a random bit of an individual and examines whether changing this bit improves the fitness of the individual. Then it goes to the next bit, etc. After it tried out all bits of the individual, it checks whether it has made at least one improvement, and if so it continues to try to change bits and otherwise it stops. Note that the local hillclimber may need many evaluations to change a single individual. Therefore, the use of local hillclimbing may not always be very effective.  

## Comparisons between memetic algorithms and other algorithms.
Memetic algorithms have already been compared to GAs on a number of combinatorial optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) (Radcliffe and Surry, 1994) 
and experimental results indicated that the memetic algorithms found much better solutions than standard genetic algorithms.
Memetic algorithms have also been compared to the Ant Colony System (Dorigo et al., 1996), (Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997) and
to Tabu Search (Glover and Laguna, 1997) and results indicated that memetic algorithms outperformed both of them on the 
Quadratic Assignment Problem (Merz and Freisleben, 1999). Thus, memetic algorithms provide us with a powerful method for
solving complex problems,

## Solving Server Placement Problem using Memetic Algorithm  

Genes -> An array of selected nodes for the requests  
Fitness -> Number of requests which can be placed on their selected node  
Goal -> Maximizing fitness or maximizing the number of requests which are placed on nodes
